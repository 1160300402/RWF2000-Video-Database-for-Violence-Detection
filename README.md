## Detection of Violent Behavior under Surveillance Camera



### Introduction

With the increasing of surveillance cameras in modern cities, huge amount of videos can be collected. While there are insufficient human resource for  monitoring all the screens at  one time. 

We are considering how to use techniques of video understanding to detect violent behavior so that it can give a quick alarm in time.



### Dataset

- Collected raw surveillance videos from YouTube, sliced them into clips within 5s at 30 fps, and labeled each clip as Violent or Non-Violent Behaviorã€‚

- Dropped duplicated contents which appear in both training set and validation set.

- Finally we got 2000 clips and 300,000 frames as a new data set for real-world violent behavior detection under surveillance camera.

### Problems

Since all the videos are captured by surveillance cameras in public places, many of them may not have a good imaging quality due to dark environment, fast movement of object, lighting blur, etc. Here are some examples:

- Only part of the person appears in the picture
